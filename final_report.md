# Exploring the Impact of Architectural Differences on Quality Assurance Approaches: A Comparative Study of Microservices, Monolithic, and Blockchain Architectures

## Abstract

## I. Introduction

<p> < General information about how industry tend to leave centric architectures. ><br>
< Chronological enhancement of software architecture, Monolithic -> SOA -> Microservice -> Blockchain ><br>
< How architectural decision and design is able to effect Quality Assurance activities. >
</p>

## III. Research Method

<p>
< What is SLR and how we created our SLR paper >
< How we find papers >
< How we choose these papers, give reference to phase 1 >
< How we reduced the number of the papers, give reference to phase 3 >
</p>

### Goal Metric Question

<p>
< Why we use GMQ, how we used it ><br>
< What are our questions ><br>
< Why, we choose these questions ><br>
< GMQ table >
</p>

### Phase One

< What we done at the phase 1 and what we planned to do >

### Phase Two

< What we done at the phase 2 and what we planned to do >

### Phase Three

< What we done at the phase 3 and what we planned to do >

## II. Literature Review

### Monolithic

<p>
< Discuss about monolithic architecture >
< Discuss about monolithic architecture quality assurance, quality attributes, tools, approaches, problems >
</p>

### Microservice

<p>
< Discuss about microservice architecture >
< Discuss about microservice architecture quality assurance, quality attributes, tools, approaches, problems >
</p>

### Blockchain

<p>
< Discuss about blockchain architecture >
< Discuss about blockchain architecture quality assurance, quality attributes, tools, approaches, problems >
</p>

### Resulting

<p>
< Discuss about all architectures with comparative approach >
< Discuss about all architectures quality assurance, quality attributes, tools, approaches, problems with comparative approach architecture >
</p>

## IV. Conclusion

<p>
< General Summarization >
</p>

### Further Research
