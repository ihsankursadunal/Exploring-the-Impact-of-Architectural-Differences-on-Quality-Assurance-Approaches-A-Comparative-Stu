# Exploring the Impact of Architectural Differences on Quality Assurance Approaches: A Comparative Study of Microservices, Monolithic, and Blockchain Architectures

## Abstract

## I. Introduction

<p> 
In recent years, there has been a huge trend to shift architectural designs in industries from traditional monolithic architectures to more flexible, scalable solutions. Increasing scale of the system and cost also make stake holders to invest these kind of solutions. Such as banking systems that requires constantly feature generation. While migrating their system also noticed that in order to implement properly, quality assurance part also needs to be addressed. They faced problems especially while shifting from monolithic to more appropriate architectures such as SOA which is implementation of monolithic, microservice and blockchain. In order to migrate their functional and nonfunctional requirements, quality assurance practices took place from design phase to maintenance in order to provide more controllable and problem addressed environment. For example monitoring actives let migrators to observe problematic sides of the decomposing centralized system. Further it enables migrators to foresee about how to control test and maintain new system with comparing functionalities of the old system. Architectural selection between monolithic, microservice and blockchain relies on their specifications and benefits that provided by nature of the architectures such as immutable registry, zero trust management, decomposed components, deployability. Monolithic architecture, losing its popularity because of been tightly-coupled components, being single centralized system. These structures causes poor adaptability, scalability and being hard to avoid possible diverse faults. Industry changed attention to microservice architecture after recognizing these drawbacks with loosely-coupled, granular components. This portable and modular practice enabled independent development, deployment and scaling of the provide components which provides better agility and scalability. Industry is also exploring the blockchain architecture, its potential data management and trust management mechanisms. Blockchain architecture offers more decentralized and immutable records, further it also provides better security and transparency. By exploring and investing these architectures, they endeavor to create more resilient, scalable, innovative and also affordable systems for the future.

Looking for a better approach leads decision-makers to create a better solution after insufficiencies come to light. Monolithic microservices are unable to provide desired features such as deployability and scalability-related features. SOA got to help. Centralized bus-dependent components started to take the place of the monolithic systems. With this awakening, the necessity for quality began to be understood and improved because management, monitoring, testing, and maintenance activities changed. Change brings defects, and in order to avoid these defects, developers and decision-makers started to look for practices for defect detection and avoidance activities. Besides the quality assurance activities formerly used, this new approach requires additional attention to provide quality assurance. Decentralized monitoring, error tracking systems, automated deployment, and scalability concerns pushed them to create new infrastructure. After the SOA, with the increase in scalability and deployability requirements Microservice architecture takes place in the literature. Microservices have much more to offer, such as the ability to use different programming languages and engines. But as a drawback, microservices place an additional networking layer between components, and communication protocols need to be managed. This new layer is dependent on the underlying network and its capabilities. Thanks to improvements in internet infrastructure, globally distributed microservices have become more common. After infrastructure improvements, communication between nodes in a network (the internet) became affordable and easy. These improvements led to the implementation of a network protocol, which is blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamato proposes a document that provides a protocol that provides instructions for managing data in a network by network participants. A decentralized, immutable lager. Then a very complete implementation of blockchain comes up, which is Ethereum. Ethereum offers much more complex features for its users. That's why we called it "architectures near other architectures. Communication, security (part of it), immutability, and other features made blockchain a noticeable alternative for some microservice domains. But as a new architectural option, it needs attention, especially on the quality aspect. Globally decentralized labor requires global infrastructure to be observed and maintained. Luckily, built-in infrastructure provides some quality assurance requirements. For example, completely open public chains provide all their contents to the public, which means any node in the network can observe and analyze them. But more critical parts still need to be handled, such as dynamic testing. We have been motivated to provide this paper in order to create a literature review to improve quality activities by comparing quality attributes, tools, and approaches with other architectures.
